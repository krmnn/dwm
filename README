dwm - dynamic window manager
============================

my configuration of dwm, an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

this is an attempt to combine the ideas of dynamic tiling window management with the ux/ergonomic considerations of the infamous "why tiling window managers suck" [rant](http://xahlee.info/linux/why_tiling_window_manager_sucks.html).


Objectives: simple, ergonomic, reasonable

Goals:

- Use more of a tagging approach instead of abusing tags as traditional workspaces
- Get rid of key chords
  - Remove modifiers for most used actions. Use F1-12 keys instead.
  - Maybe keep vim-style keybindings for moving and orientation
  - Switch to sticky keys/key sequences wherever not possible to completely remove modifier
  - Use only thumbs for modifiers, never use the pinkys!
- Automate my most used actions and workflows
  - tag all relevant clients automatically, handle popups and floating clients correctly
  - predefined layouts 
  - functions to superimpose browser or mail client into current tag
- Practical
  - provide systray so we can out-source wifi/bluetooth/volume management and not fiddle with shellscripts
  - include all patches that deal with broken software 
- Distinctive, easy-to-read colorscheme based on Tango color palette
- One-click install: status script and xsession launch script included


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
